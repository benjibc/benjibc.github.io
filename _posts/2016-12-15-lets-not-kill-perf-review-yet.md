> The reality is, even when companies get rid of performance evaluations, ratings still exist. 

> At Facebook we analyzed our performance management system a few years ago. We conducted focus groups and a follow-up survey with more than 300 people. The feedback was clear: 87% of people wanted to keep performance ratings.

# Making things fair

> research has long shown that when the process is fair, employees are more willing to accept undesirable outcomes. A fair process exists when evaluators are credible and motivated to get it right, and employees have a voice. 

> At Facebook, to mitigate bias and do things systematically, we start by having peers write evaluations. They share them not just with managers but also, in most cases, with one another—which reflects the company’s core values of openness and transparency. Then decisions are made about performance: Managers sit together and discuss their reports face-to-face, defending and championing, debating and deliberating, and incorporating peer feedback. Here the goal is to minimize the “idiosyncratic rater effect”—also known as personal opinion. People aren’t unduly punished when individual managers are hard graders or unfairly rewarded when they’re easy graders.

> Next managers write the performance reviews. We have a team of analysts who examine evaluations for bias (after the managers’ names have been stripped away). For instance, are words like “abrasive” used more often to describe women—and how might that be affecting their assessments, their promotions, their pay?

> And last, we translate our ratings directly into compensation. Notably, this process involves a formula, so managers have no discretion in compensation decisions. It’s fair: If you excel, your bonus multiplier rises according to a predetermined equation, not someone’s opinion. This focuses managers on what they can accurately assess and allows the company to manage pay using compensation expertise. It’s also a huge time-saver. When other companies eliminate performance evaluations, they still spend many hours agonizing over compensation decisions. For us, time invested in performance reviews is time saved on compensation.

# Being transparent
> Many companies that are abandoning performance evaluations are moving to real-time feedback systems. That is an excellent way to help people repeat their successes and learn from their failures. But it doesn’t help them—or the organization—gauge how they’re doing overall.

Global information is really important.

> In the CEB survey mentioned earlier, people whose companies had eliminated evaluations judged their performance conversations 14% more negatively than those whose organizations still used them. (The people who had fared better under the old system were, understandably, the most miffed.) At Facebook a focus group participant said that ratings serve as a punctuation mark, because they’re clear. Another participant said she likes “having the chance to be a unicorn.” We value outsize contributions—and those who deliver them should feel appreciated.

# Developing People
> When people receive negative feedback, they often fixate on small points. Without ratings, they can spend weeks pruning a few trees while the forest is on fire.
